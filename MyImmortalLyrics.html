    I'm so tired of being here
    Suppressed by all my childish fears
    And if you have to leave
    I wish that you would just leave
    'Cause your presence still lingers here
    And it won't leave me alone
    These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
    There's just too much that time cannot erase
    When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
    When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
    And I held your hand through all of these years
    But you still have all of me
    You used to captivate me by your resonating light
    Now, I'm bound by the life you left behind
    Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
    Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
    These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
    There's just too much that time cannot erase
    When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
    When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
    And I held your hand through all of these years
    But you still have all of me
    I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
    But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along
    When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
    When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
    And I held your hand through all of these years
    You still have all of me, me, me
